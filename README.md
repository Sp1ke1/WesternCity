3D OpenGL C++ application from FIT CTU Graphics Programming course.

## About the project
I followed an interactive app in Western style. 
It features basic camera movement, a Phong lighting model, and a variety of interactivity and animations. 
For example, you can open a chest and pick up a good old revolver. After all, a suspicious eagle flies over the city. You have to do something about it!
Of the interesting things, the project supports adding models through a map file, some objects have specular textures, and all rotations are implemented using quaternions.

## Controls
